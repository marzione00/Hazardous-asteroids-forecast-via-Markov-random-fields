In the left panel an active PM is considered: this is modelled by making more likeable that the PM impose the lock-down as the number of infected goes over the different thresholds. On the contrary, in the left panel a lazy PM that prefer the \textit {laissez-faire} approach is considered: in this case, differently with respect to the previous scenario, the probability that the PM impose the lock-down is less likely. \relax }}{18}{figure.caption.6}%
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {5}{\ignorespaces Comparison between the sales effects for the scenarios where an active vs lazy PM is considered. These effects were calculated by running a DID regression for the different national lock-down imposed during March-June 2020 and then multiplying the number of lock-down weeks, obtianed from the SIRD scenario ,with the coefficients obtained from the DID (divided by 4). The error bars were calculated by considering the error propagation \relax }}{19}{figure.caption.7}%
